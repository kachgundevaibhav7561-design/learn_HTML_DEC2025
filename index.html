    <p>Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth. The field of geology
        encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth
        materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic
        discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of
        natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.[20]
